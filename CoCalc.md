# EduVPN-CoCalc

## Cocalc Set-up

Cocalc is a virtual online workspace which can be used for research or teaching.<br>
It can be used for many computer languages like bash, R, python or jypyter notebooks.<br>
Projects can be shared to collaborate with other students/researchers and chatrooms can be made to communicate. <br>

Personal Cocalc environments can be made, like the one we use at Avans Hogeschool.<br>

1.) To access the Cocalc environment you first have to login to EduVPN [see EduVPN Setup tutorial](./EduVPN.md))<br>
2.) Next use your internet client to go to [cocalc.atgm.avans.nl](cocalc.atgm.avans.nl).<br>
_Now you should see this page_<br>

3.) Now Sign In if you already have an account, otherwise use the Sign Up button to create an account.<br>
_As a safety precausion, you'll only be able to access Cocalc with a registration token, this can be acquired by one of the bioinf TOA's_<br>
_Or it might be shared in brightspace_<br>

- See some information about CoCalc and get to its documentation page.
- Change something in your account settings, like enable "Dark Mode", change color schemes and many more.
