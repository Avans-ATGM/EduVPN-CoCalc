# EduVPN-CoCalc

## Cocalc Set-up

Cocalc is a virtual online workspace which can be used for research or teaching.
It can be used for many computer languages like bash, R, python or jypyter notebooks.
Projects can be shared to collaborate with other students/researchers and chatrooms can be made to communicate. <br>
